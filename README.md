# IDP — Intelligent Document Processing for Affordable-Housing Certifications

IDP is a FastAPI service that audits affordable-housing tenant certifications
(LIHTC / HUD 50059 / TIC / RD 3560-8). It performs a second, independent
extraction of a certification packet and **reconciles it against the MuleSoft
data already in Salesforce**, then writes a per-case audit report back to the
Case record for a human analyst to review.

---

## 1. Why this exists

When a tenant certification packet (often 50–60+ scanned pages) is uploaded,
**MuleSoft** extracts structured data from it into Salesforce. MuleSoft misses
and mislabels things. IDP is a **peer extractor**: it independently extracts the
same packet with OCR + LLMs, runs document-level compliance checks, and then
diffs its result against MuleSoft's.

Neither side is treated as ground truth — they **supplement each other**:

| | MuleSoft | IDP |
|---|---|---|
| Strength | Often complete coverage | Correct member identity, document compliance |
| Weakness | Mislabels (e.g. funding-program names in the member field), duplicates | Can drop a source, OCR errors |

The audit's value is the **asymmetric findings** (one side has something the
other doesn't) plus the **compliance gates** (unsigned forms, missing Race/
Ethnic data form, etc.) — surfaced to an analyst with a confidence score.

                  Analyst reviews findings in Salesforce / dashboard
```

Each webhook returns **202 Accepted** immediately and runs the heavy work in a
background task. State is persisted in a local SQLite **JobStore** so repeated
signals for the same case are de-duplicated and crashed jobs can be recovered.

---

## 3. The IDP extraction pipeline

Entry point: `app/services/pdf_service.py::process_pdf_full` →
`app/services/pipeline.py::run_extraction_pipeline`.

```
PDF
 └─ render pages (PyMuPDF @ 200 DPI)
     └─ preprocess images (OpenCV → 1280×1920)
         └─ OCR (external OCR service; Claude Vision fallback for low-quality pages)
             └─ page_texts ──► run_extraction_pipeline:
                 1. Two-pass classify + group        (keyword pass, then one LLM pass)
                 2. Route document groups by category (demographics / cert / income / asset)
                 3. LLM extraction (one call per schema):
                      • household demographics
                      • certification info (effective date, rent, totals, signatures…)
                      • income sources
                      • assets
                 4. Income calculations (annualize each source, Section 9)
                 5. Build document inventories (HUD forms, financial docs)
                 6. Questionnaire disclosures + name reconciliation
                 7. Compile compliance findings (signatures, required forms, special scenarios)
                 8. Multi-stage field-level scoring → extraction confidence
```

LLM calls go through `app/services/llm_service.py` (Anthropic Claude). Extraction
runs on Sonnet; classification runs on Haiku (separate capacity pool, cheaper for
a constrained labeling task).

### Self-healing retries

LLM extraction is non-deterministic, so each extractor re-asks for what the first
pass dropped. All retries share one driver, `_retry_if_incomplete` (gate → fill,
max 1, failures swallowed so first-pass data is never lost):

- **Certification info** — re-ask for critical fields that came back null.
- **Income amounts** — a source with a name but no dollar figure triggers a
  targeted re-ask for just those amounts.
- **Income source coverage** — a classified benefit document (SSA / SSI / SSDI /
  pension / child support) that produced no record of its type is re-extracted on
  its own (grounded in a real document; never invents income to fill a gap).
- **Assets** — when the record count is below the number of asset documents, the
  missed documents are re-extracted.

---

## 4. The reconciliation (comparator)

`app/services/audit/comparator.py::compare(extraction, sf_data)` diffs the IDP
extraction against MuleSoft and returns findings + a confidence score. It compares
four record families plus the IDP-internal findings:

- **Members** — matched on (DOB, SSN last-4) with a fuzzy name fallback.
- **Income** — matched on normalized source + member; a member-agnostic pass also
  matches by **source + annualized amount** so MuleSoft's unreliable member field
  (e.g. a funding-program label) doesn't break matching. Income-source synonyms
  (SSA/SSI/SSDI/SSP/TANF) are normalized with word-boundary matching.
- **Assets** — global best-first one-to-one assignment; balance-matching pairs
  rank above name-only pairs so multiple same-bank accounts don't mis-pair.
- **Certification scalars** — effective date, cert type, unit number
  (prefix-normalized), household income total, household size, and rent
  (reconciled the LIHTC way: gross = tenant + utility allowance).

### Confidence score

```
case_confidence = extraction_score × 0.6 + agreement_rate × 0.4
flag            = green (≥0.85) | yellow (≥0.65) | red
```

A **high-severity comparison disagreement** (e.g. a year-off effective date) caps
the flag at **yellow** — a single critical mismatch can't be averaged into a
false green. Zero-value/immaterial items are de-escalated to NOTES.

---

## 5. Output report format

Findings are rendered by `app/services/audit/formatter.py` into the
`Case.IDP_Testing_Results__c` text field, split by the *source* of the finding:

```
--- AI FILE AUDIT ---
Case: CAS574128
Processed: 2026-05-28
Confidence: 81% (YELLOW)
Findings: 5 from comparison, 1 from IDP analysis

=== MULESOFT COMPARISON ===          ← IDP vs MuleSoft diffs

  - ...

=== IDP ANALYSIS ===                  ← compliance / field-quality / notes
[CRITICAL]
  - Certification form (TIC/HUD 50059) is NOT signed — resubmission required ...

---
Stats: 4 agreements, 2 disagreements, 3 AI-only, 0 MuleSoft-only
Extraction score: 0.90, Agreement rate: 0.67
```

Severity → bucket: `high → [CRITICAL]`, `medium → [REVIEW]`, `low/info → [NOTES]`.

## 6. HTTP API

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /webhook/audit-ready` | **Recommended.** MuleSoft is done → run the full chain (download → extract → compare → writeback). |
| `POST /webhook/pdf-attached` | Legacy 2-webhook flow: start extraction only. |
| `POST /webhook/mulesoft-done` | Legacy 2-webhook flow: run comparison once MuleSoft is done. |
| `GET  /audit/cases` | List audit jobs from the JobStore (filter by `state`, paginated). |
| `GET  /audit/cases/{case_id}` | Inspect one case: findings text + IDP extraction + MuleSoft data (3-panel dashboard view). |
| `POST /admin/audit-jobs/reset` | Clear JobStore rows so cases can be re-audited (`mode`: `done` / `by_ids` / `all`). |
| `GET  /health` | Liveness/readiness check. |

**Auth:** webhooks require a bearer token matching `IDP_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN`
(fail-closed in production; bypass only with `IDP_DEV_MODE=true` for local dev).

**Webhook payload** (audit-ready / pdf-attached):

```json
{
  "case_id": "500XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "case_number": "CAS574128",
  "cert_type": "AR",                       // MI | AR | AR-SC | IR (others → 422)
  "funding_program": "LIHTC",              // LIHTC | HUD | USDA | ...
  "content_document_id": "069XXXXXXXXXXXX" // optional; else IDP scans the case
}
```

---

## 7. Integration modes (`IDP_AUDIT_MODE`)

- `webhook` (default) — Salesforce pushes signals. Lowest latency; needs
  Salesforce-side Apex triggers + named credentials.
- `poll` — IDP polls Salesforce on an interval for ready cases. No SF-side setup;
  higher latency / API load. Webhooks return 503 in this mode.
- `both` — useful during transition.

A **maintenance thread** runs in every mode: it prunes terminal JobStore rows
older than `IDP_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` and a **watchdog** re-queues cases wedged
mid-flight after a crash/deploy (up to `IDP_AUDIT_WATCHDOG_MAX_RETRIES`).

### Job lifecycle states

`pending → extracting → extracted → comparing → done`
plus terminal failure states: `extraction_failed`, `comparison_failed`,
`mulesoft_timeout`. State is stored in SQLite at `output/audit_jobs.db`.

## 10. Running locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (Python 3.11+)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure — create a .env file with the IDP_* values above
#   (for local dev without webhook auth: set IDP_DEV_MODE=true)

# 3. Run the API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 4. Smoke-test a webhook (dev mode)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/audit-ready \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"case_id":"500...","case_number":"CAS000001","cert_type":"AR","funding_program":"LIHTC"}'

# 5. Inspect the result
curl http://localhost:8000/audit/cases/500...
```

Requires a reachable OCR service, valid Anthropic + Salesforce credentials. PDFs
under `IDP_MIN_PDF_PAGES` (default 4) are rejected as non-source documents.

## 11. Glossary

- **TIC** — Tenant Income Certification.
- **HUD 50059 / RD 3560-8** — agency certification forms.
- **Cert types** — `MI` (move-in), `AR` (annual recert), `AR-SC` (annual
  self-certification), `IR` (interim recert).
- **Gross rent (LIHTC)** — tenant-paid rent + utility allowance.
- **MuleSoft** — the upstream integration that extracts packet data into
  Salesforce; IDP audits its output.
